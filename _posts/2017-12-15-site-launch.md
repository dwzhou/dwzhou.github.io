Hello to the approximately 0 people who will see this! I'm starting a personal website. I'll use this to practice HTML/CSS and record my progress on personal projects, if I can actually remember to update this.

Thanks to [this tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for holding my hand through the creation of this page. Hopefully, I can spin off and do my own thing from now on.
